I'm currently a student and part time junior developer in the Vancouver area.
I want to create the best digital experiences in the world.

Although my background and education is technical, I very much enjoy
integrating my work with design principles as well as attention to aesthetic detail.

When i'm not working or studying I love making video games,
reading, working out and exploring city streets listening to my favorite music.
